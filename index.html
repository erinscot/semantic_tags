      <h1>What's In A Name?</h1>
      <p>Shakespeare said, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." He meant the name of a thing doesn't matter. Call a rose "aeraera" (the words my left hand typed at random), and the smell is the same.</p>

      <p>But Shakespeare didn't have the interent. And in HTML, words matter. And that's where semantic tags come into play. Gone are the days of "div" defining everything and yet meaning nothing. Fear not. HTML5 is here to save the day.</p>

    <h4>Would you like it as much, or even understand what it is, if it were called "aeraera"? Doubt it. So let's call things what they are and make everyone's lives a little easier, huh, Bill?</h4>
